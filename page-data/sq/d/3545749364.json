The primary focus of Shinto Society is to bring fans of anime, story-telling, NFT enthusiasts and others together in a safe space to interact, engage in healthy discussion, and utilize the project's art as a way to represent themselves in the future of the metaverse. We exist because YOU do. Simply put, each piece of art was hand crafted prior to it's algorithmic generation to represent someone out there in the world. While it is difficult to represent 100% of the world, we strive to touch the inner being of as many as possible through art, giving each person a chance to have a voice in this vast world.","calendarEvent":"Go Mint Shinto Society!","connectWallet":"Connect Wallet","signOut":"Sign Out","myNFTs":"My NFTs"}}]}}}
